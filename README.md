In today’s day and age there has been a strong push for the reduction in production and use of fossil fuels. Per Peninsula Energy fossil fuels “produce a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide methane,” [1] These greenhouse gas emissions are known to be a main contributor to the ‘greenhouse effect’ “the warming of climate that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth towards space,” [2] Not only does thermal power produced by fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases, it is not renewable, meaning it cannot be “replaced naturally in a short period of time” resulting in long-term price volatility and unsustainability.

For the purposes of this analysis we will be using Eurostat European Energy data (Eurostat, 2020) assess how successful they currently are at moving towards sustainable energy and answer the question:

How sustainable is the energy production in Europe?

Specifically:

* Which countries have the highest production of sustainable energy based on energy types?
* How do energy imports vs exports compare between countries in Europe from 2016-2018?
* How the contributions of the sources to the production of electricity?

# Steps

4. Write your data description under the header Data description in `index.Rmd`. A data description should tell the reader the source of the data, and detail the structure of the data, including variables, time frame of collection, collection methods. 

5. Brainstorm what questions would be possible to answer with this data (and only this data). Articulate the primary question, and then three secondary questions. 

6. Finish your report, which should be structured as follows
    - Introduction and motivation: Give the bigger picture of the data, and inspire the reader to learn more about the problem by reading your analysis. 
    - Data description
    - Analysis and Findings, which includes at least one plot or numerical summary for each of your questions, that helps the reader arrive at an answer. You should also write paragraphs describing the methods, summaries and findings. 
    - References

7.  Provide peer feedback on assigned report. You will be randomly assigned another team's report, and be expected to reproduce their analysis, and provide constructive input on the analysis. The purpose of peer feedback is to learn how other analysts approach problems, and to help improve other analysts analyses.
